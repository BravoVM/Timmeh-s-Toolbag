Timmeh's Toolbag Mod for Jagged Alliance 3
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026346564

Updated and cleaned for use with JA3 patch 1.5.  No longer breaks Bobby Ray's.
This code should be save game compatable.  Though, if you had one of the existing incompatible tool bags in your inventory, that item will be trashed.

WARNING: if you have an incompatible tool bag in your inventory, that item will be trashed.
Stand alone tool bags (aka, with no tools in it) will be fine.

If you want make it NOT save-game compatible, edit the metadata.lua and change the id field.

NOTE: The original is not my code.  If Timmeh wants me to take this down, I will do so.
